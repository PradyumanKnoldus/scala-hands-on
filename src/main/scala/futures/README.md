## Futures

Roadmap to learn about Futures in Scala:

>Understand the concept of Futures

Start by understanding what Futures are and why they are used. Futures provide a way to represent the result of a computation that may not be available yet, allowing you to write non-blocking code.

>Learn about the Future API

Scala has a built-in Future API that you can use to create and manage Futures. Learn about the different methods and operations available in the Future API, such as map, flatMap, onComplete, and recover.

>Explore asynchronous programming

Futures are often used in asynchronous programming, where you want to perform multiple operations concurrently without blocking the main thread. Learn about the different techniques and patterns used in asynchronous programming, such as callbacks, promises, and actors.

>Practice with real-world examples

Try implementing some real-world examples using Futures, such as fetching data from a remote API or performing complex computations in parallel.

>Learn about Futures in depth

Once you have a good grasp of the basics, dive deeper into Futures by learning about advanced topics such as composition, error handling, and cancellation.

>Explore third-party libraries

There are many third-party libraries that build on top of the Scala Future API and provide additional functionality, such as monadic abstractions and reactive programming. Explore some of these libraries and see how they can help you write more concise and expressive code.

>Practice, practice, practice

As with any skill, the key to mastering Futures is practice. Keep working on challenging problems and experimenting with different techniques and libraries to build your knowledge and expertise.
